### Backlog

### Submission

Mark: Pass

### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback: 
* The Non-Functional requirements section placement it's a bit weird. You basically split the functional requirements sections, and it is not clear why you do it like this.
* You include all important parts of the backlog.

### Epics

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: 
* You divide the requirements into Epics, with appropriate names and granularity.
* Please make sure that in the backlog, these sections are in a prioritized order, like presented in the lecture.
* Each epic should have a description that introduces the feature and clarifies the scope of whatâ€™s being implemented, please make sure you revise this part.
("functionality that has been initially described through the epic is actually covered in user stories", I think that you confuse the user story with the epic description).
* Use user stories to provide more information about the description of the epic, but they can not completely replace it.

### User Stories

Mark: Good

Feedback:
* All user stories follow the who/what/why format and (most of the time) describe one feature at a time.
	* revise user stories 8 and 9 from basic - can you split these?
	* Story 6 it's unclear - rephrase?
* Make sure you complement the description (that is currently missing) with the user stories.
* Make sure that the user stories fully cover all required actions that the user should be able to do (you did not consider editing/deletion).

### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 
* Most user stories as small enough and have clear acceptance criteria - see feedback for the user story.
* Some acceptance criteria are a bit too specific (you also mention the placing of buttons, try to avoid this if it was not specifically asked by the client).
