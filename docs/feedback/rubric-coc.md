# Code of conduct

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback:
* submission looks good.

### General

Mark: Good
Feedback: 
* Good overall, for some sections you did not go into too many details, have you discussed them properly
during the meeting when you wrote the CoC?

### Assignment Description

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
* Good description, summarizes everything

### Products

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: 
* Product section refers to what you will deliver at the end of the project: so the actual app, and other assignments (eg: backlog, HCI assignment)
* It is important to have a clear view of the goals of this course.

### Planning

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: 
* More topics to think about:
	- concrete description of how the division of work will happen?
	- do you want someone named as responsible for submitting deliverables?
	- will you set some soft deadlines within the team to make sure that the final deadline is met?

### Communication

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
* For what is Discord used/ for what is Mattermost used?
* how fast do you expect to receive an answer? Do you expect everyone to be available after 6 PM/during the weekends (ideas to think/write about)

### Commitment

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
* Commitment of the chair/ minute taker is determined by the number of issues discussed.
	- how about the quality of the agenda/notes; did they upload the agenda/notes on time?

### Division of Tasks and Roles
  
Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: 
* How about the division of other tasks in the team? You will soon start coding so you will need to discuss how are you
going to divide these tasks.
	- will you have a separate meeting for task division? how is the meeting going to look like?
* I would suggest revising this section

### Meetings

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
* Good that you already have some meetings scheduled for every week, but what are the goals for these meetings?
	- eg: you will probably need a meeting at the end of the sprint to make sure that everyone is done with the tasks/
	everything is ready to be merged; also you need a meeting to divide the tasks, when is that going to take place? Think about this.

### Decision Making

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
* Kicking someone off the team is a bit too much if they don't agree :))
	- eg: an idea (of course it depends on the topic) would be to ask the TA for guidance/ an opinion.

### Dealing with Conflicts

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
* A bit too general, but it also depends on each type of conflict. A suggestion would be that if you notice something
that keeps repeating, write about the situation in the CoC and a way to solve it.

### Guidance

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
* What kind of feedback do you expect from the TA?

### Consequences

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: 
* A bit too general:
	- what happens if someone is late? What if they miss the meeting completely? What if this keeps happening?
	- what if a member is not on time with their tasks?

### Success Factors

Mark: Good

Feedback: -

### Norms or Evaluation Criteria

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: 
* Think about why it's important to have each evaluation criteria
