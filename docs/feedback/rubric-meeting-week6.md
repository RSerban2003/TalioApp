# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Alexis
Minute taker: Rares

Mark: Pass

#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 
* Agenda on GitLab before meeting
* I really like the format of the agenda, with the sections and bullet points for each.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: 
* (This is for week 6 agenda minutes)
* It is not clear which are the notes and which is the agenda text. TIP: add the notes in a different color.
* The notes are not very informative, the answers are short and miss quite some information discussed during the meeting (e.g: the discussion about HCI
was longer and more was discussed)
* TIP: alsi include our stand-up (i.e: when everyone gives the updates)
