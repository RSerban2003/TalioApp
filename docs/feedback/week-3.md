# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Max
Minute taker: Farhan  

Mark: Pass

Feedback: -


#### Agenda 

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: 
* Agenda was not in repo before meeting. Can you make sure that the agendas are always in repo, at leastest Tuesday morning?
* Now that you understand how the meetings work, I think you can put a bit more effort in writing/thinking about what to write
in the agendas. It should be a document that help the others preper for the topics that will be discussed in the meeting, such that they can 
prepare questions if necessary.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
* Notes were merged in the agenda.
* I do not see that many notes regarding the topics/feedback discussed during the meeting
* Good that you included a list of tasks for each member


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
* We had 2 meetings in the hybrid setting and it sometimes seemed like the chair forgot about the person joining online.
=> make sure you involved everyone equally.
* Topics were covered within the time frame, but we also had some extra time at the end. I assume that after you start coding, 
you will come up with more topics to discuss.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
* You took ownership for most of the meeting, but sometimes it felt that not everyone was fully focused on the topic that was
discussed by the chair at that moment (i.e: you were busy with a different task that was previously mentioned). Try to stay 
focused to the current topic and for example take a note if you want to do something urgent after the meeting.
* It is great that the general attitude is constructive and that everyone is respectful to eachother.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: 
* not applicable this week, but take into consideration that starting next week you are expected to start writing code
and give updates during the TA meeting.
