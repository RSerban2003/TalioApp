# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Farhan
Minute taker: Alexis 
Mark: Pass

Feedback: -


#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: 
* Agenda on Git before the meeting (that's great!!)
* I really liked how you separated the items in the agenda (eg: Agenda item 1 - Meaningful MR) and that you have a few bulletpoints for each.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
* Most points discussed in the meeting were covered in the notes.
* I think it would be nicer to have a clear separation between the text of the agenda vs the notes (eg: change the color of notes to blue or something along these lines)
* From this week you already started coding. Make sure that as a minute taker you also include the updates from you and the team members so that you have a more clear overview
(as you are going to discuss the updates with me anyways). 

#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 
* Great performance, you went to all the points in a very organised manner.
* As a tip, I would say that when you notice that the discussion deviates the main subject (OOPP), try to intervine a but to cut it off.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
* Everyone actively participates in the meetings, which is great.
* Again as last week, it would be nice if everyone pays attention to the person talking and avoid doing other things during the meeting/ forming pairs
of 2 and discussing separately. As a chair, if you notice this, you can intervine and ask everyone to pay more attention to what is discussed.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: 
* Great start on coding. Make sure that every week you have something new to show me (frontend updates about screens and endpoints in Postman for backend)
* As a reminder, split the tasks equally and make sure that everyone is ok with their tasks (do this division together). If you are done with your tasks,
don't just take new ones, but discuss this with the teammates and let them know. It is important that everyone is aware of eachothers work.


Last week
- issues for all endpoints 
- basic entities (board, task list) (Alexis)
- add comments, add repository (Max)
- pannel for tasks (Rares)
- connection page to fill in url of the server (Samuel)
