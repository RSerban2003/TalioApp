\section{Introduction}
In this report we will be evaluating a prototype for the client of our task board application. We have recruited a team of experts to be our evaluators, to provide new insights we wouldn't have gotten by looking at the prototype ourselves. The end goal of this process is to improve the usability of our design and by extension our final application.
\newline
Our prototype consist of a series of wireframes, see appendix \ref{appendix:a}.
